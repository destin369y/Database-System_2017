    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to write several SQL queries that will answer questions about a set of surgical cases. \n",
    "The data is based on the Anaesthetic Shoulder Arthroscopy Cases (ASAC) Dataset from David Cumin. I have made some minor modificiations to the data, so be sure to use the version of the data available on the course Canvas site. If you are interested, you can learn more about the dataset at https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/5378. \n",

    "6. AN_VITALS(ID, SIGNALTIME, SIGNALNAME, VALUE)\n",

    "\n",
    "1. AN_CASE contains an entry for each surgical case. It includes the patient's name, gender, height and weight. The ASA is the American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status classification, and reflects the patient's ability to tolerate the surgery. DOB is the patient's date of birth and OPDATE is the date the operation happened. PROC describes the procedures performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. AN_COMORBID contains a list of patient conditions, such as smoking or asthma. Patients can have different numbers of comborbidities. Comorbidities are described using an ICD code (ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code) and a text description. Some conditions include additional information in the DETAILS field.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. AN_DRUGCATEGORY contains a list of different medications used during the surgical cases and their categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. AN_DRUG contains a list of medications administered during each surgical case along with the details of the administration (dose, time, method, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. AN_EVENT contains key events during the surgical case.  Each row includes the case id, time the event occurred and description of the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. AN_VITALS contains the vital sign data (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) collected during each case.\n"
