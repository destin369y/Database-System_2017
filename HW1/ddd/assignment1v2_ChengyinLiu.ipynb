    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to write several SQL queries that will answer questions about a set of surgical cases. \n",
    "The data is based on the Anaesthetic Shoulder Arthroscopy Cases (ASAC) Dataset from David Cumin. I have made some minor modificiations to the data, so be sure to use the version of the data available on the course Canvas site. If you are interested, you can learn more about the dataset at https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/5378. \n",

    "2. AN_COMORBID(ID, ICD, DESCR, DETAILS) \n",
    "\n",
    "3. AN_DRUGCATEGORY(DRNAME, DRCAT)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. AN_DRUG(ID, DRNAME, DRTIME, DRVALUE, DRUNIT, DRROUTE, DRCOMMENT)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. AN_EVENT(ID, EVENTTIME, EVENTDESC)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. AN_VITALS(ID, SIGNALTIME, SIGNALNAME, VALUE)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AN_CASE contains an entry for each surgical case. It includes the patient's name, gender, height and weight. The ASA is the American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status classification, and reflects the patient's ability to tolerate the surgery. DOB is the patient's date of birth and OPDATE is the date the operation happened. PROC describes the procedures performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. AN_COMORBID contains a list of patient conditions, such as smoking or asthma. Patients can have different numbers of comborbidities. Comorbidities are described using an ICD code (ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code) and a text description. Some conditions include additional information in the DETAILS field.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. AN_DRUGCATEGORY contains a list of different medications used during the surgical cases and their categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. AN_DRUG contains a list of medications administered during each surgical case along with the details of the administration (dose, time, method, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. AN_EVENT contains key events during the surgical case.  Each row includes the case id, time the event occurred and description of the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. AN_VITALS contains the vital sign data (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) collected during each case.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### (a)\n",
    "(1) Since the attribute 'signalname' is highly repetitive in the current an_vitals table, I would like to store the vital sign data in three tables as an_HR, an_SBP, and an_DBP, to store the data for HR sign, SBP sign, and DBP sign respectively. Each table has attributes as 'id', 'signaltime', and 'value'. The total number of entries is the same as the table an_vitals'. But we do not need the attribute 'signalname' in each table.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2)I think the main advantage of storing data in three tables is that we highly reduce the storage space of these sign data. Each entry of signalname name has a data type of char(3), which need 3*3 (code in utf-8) bytes. As we have more than 28000 rows in an_vitals, the space will be at lest 250 KB less than storing data in one table. Also, by separating them into multiple tables, we can avoid too many rows in a single table which is not performance-optimized.\n",
    "    \n",
    "For the disadvantages, it may not be that straightforward to access values for more than one sign at any given time point. Since the data are stored in three different tables, we need to join the tables first or union the data selected from three tables separately. Besides, if we get values of different signals, we need to insert them into the corresponding tables which may not be that convenient as inserting to just one table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (b)\n",
    "(1) Another way to structure the vital table may be separating the attribute 'value' into three attributes as 'HRvalue', 'SBPvalue', and 'DBPvalue'. Thus, we do not need the attribute 'signalname' as well. Finally the new table has attributes as following: 'id', 'signaltime', 'HRvalue', 'SBPvalue', and 'DBPvalue'.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) By structuring like this, we can store and access the values for more than one signal at each given time point in a single row. Ideally, if we have all the three signal values at every given time point, we can reduce the number of the rows by 2/3. Thus, we save 2/3 storage space of the 'id' and 'signaltime' attributes and the whole storage space of the 'signalname' attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "But not all signals have value at each given time point. If there is only one signal recorded at each time point, no value will be stored in the attributes for other signals' value, which leads to a waste of space. Through the attribute 'signalname' in the original table is dropped here, not much space is saved in this kind of bad cases."

    "(1) Currently the table an_vitals use FLOAT as the data type to store BP values. The maximum BP value in the table is 175 and the minimum is 0. And the number of decimal places is at most 2. Since the BP value of human will not exceed 300, so we can use SMALLINT as the data type to store BP values instead of FLOAT. We need to tiems all the current values by 100 in order to store they as SMALLINT type. And also need to divid them by 100 when we use them. But SMALLINT does save more space than FLOAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Each FLOAT costs 4 bytes and each SMALLINT costs 2 bytes only. As we have 28125 rows in the table an_vitals, the saved space will be approximately (4-2)*28125 = 56250 bytes, which is about 56 KB."

    "(1) The event time does not contain date or exact timestamp information. So the it may represent the difference between the time point when event happens and some specific time point (e.g., 12 o'clock midnight everyday). When the event happens before that specific time point, the event time will be a negative number.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) We should be careful when deal with data which contain time information. Events may happen before we expect. And INT may not always be a good choice for representing timestamp. It is better to record accurate time and date information as well in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) I may use DATETIME type to store event times if storage space allows. Because it is used for values that contain both date and time parts and its range is larger than TIMESTAMP. Thus, we can record detailed information of the event time and do not need to deal with negative numbers."
